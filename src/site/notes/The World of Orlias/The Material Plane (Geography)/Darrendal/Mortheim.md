<small> The map of Mortheim just before it got cloaked in thick, supernatural fog </small>

A small nation in the north-east of [[Darrendal\|Darrendal]].

**Mortheim** is a country whose culture is rooted in druidic tradition and whose landscapes are defined by lush, mixed forests and winding rivers, nestled in a large valley, seperating the [[Hammerpeaks\|Hammerpeaks]] in the south from the [[Raven-Mountains\|Raven-Mountains]] to the north. 
To its west are the treacherous [[Ravenwoods\|Ravenwoods]], a gargantuan forest swarming with [[Werewolves\|Werewolves]], [[Ghouls\|Ghouls]] and other creatures of the night.
**Mortheim** has long since learned to defend against these intruders and as such has a long and proud history of monster-hunting and expansive occult rituals to ward off against them. 

To the east of **Mortheim** you'll find [[Radovia\|Radovia]] and [[Tidenheim\|Tidenheim]], two independent nations that broke off and allied against their former country.

## History 

There aren't many records left of what the country was like before [[Strahd\|Strahd]], an ancient Vampire who ruled **Mortheim** for multiple centuries, took over in the [[The Age of kindled Magic\|second era]], but what records do remain imply a strong and proud people that lived in harmony with the land and revered it for its bounties. Some druid circles claim to have originated from this ancient **Mortheim**, but it is unsure how much truth there is to these claims.

Under [[Strahd\|Strahd's]] rule, the country became a shell of what it once was. 
Rural communities were rounded up in cities and either gained the favor of their vampiric overlord, being turned to [[Vampires\|Vampires]] in turn, or lived to serve their undead masters, being seen as little more than cheap labor at best, and cattle at worst. 

This all changed when [[Radomir Ikswobel\|Radomir Ikswobel]] took up the sword, raising it against [[Strahd\|Strahd]] and starting a feud that would last for centuries to come. It was this action, that allowed [[Tidenheim\|Tidenheim]] to split from the rest of **Mortheim**, swearing their loyalty to [[Radomir Ikswobel\|Radomir]] and promising to aid in his war against [[Strahd\|Strahd]].
Eventually this personal war of the Ikswobel family would bear fruit in the [[The Era of the Dawnfather\|third era]], when an unnamed Ikswobel would lead the charge against [[Strahd\|Strahd]]. 
Supported by [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Avalon\|avalonian missionaries]], a band of [[Wood-Elves\|Wood-Elves]] and [[Kenji Tahara\|Kenji Tahara]], better known as the bearer of the the [[Demon-Blade Izanagi\|Demon-Blade Izanagi]], they managed to slay the ancient undead, and scatter his followers into the [[Ravenwoods\|Ravenwoods]]. 

What followed was a period of relative peace for **Mortheim**. It converted to the [[Church of the Dawnfather\|Church of the Dawnfather]] as a sign of gratitude towards [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Avalon\|Avalon]], and because of the personal beliefs of its new King. The country rebuilt, they rediscovered their culture and roots and forged new diplomatic relations, even rekindling and rebuilding their connection to [[Tidenheim\|Tidenheim]]. 

This peace would not last, however. The sudden coronation of a new [[Azael von Zarovich\|Queen]] after the sudden death of the old King brought with it many changes. The country grew increasingly isolationist over the next few years and old tensions started arising again. 
**Mortheims** branch of the [[Church of the Dawnfather\|Church of the Dawnfather]], which deviated from its [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Avalon\|avalonian]] counterpart over the years, also started getting more and more extreme. 
With full support of the crown they started hunting down people they considered as heretics. [[Azael von Zarovich\|Queen Azael von Zarovich]] ruled with fear and an iron fist, subjugating and dominating those who opposed her and favoring those that would easily fold into her rule. 

This would go on for thirteen long years. It wasn't until 465 3E, where a small group consisting of [[Radovan Ikswobel\|Radovan Ikswobel]], [[Jean-Jacques Busseau\|Jean-Jacques Busseau]], [[Varelos\|Varelos]], [[Mey Lee\|Mey Lee]], [[Andriel\|Andriel]] and myself, [[Nienna Efiriel\|Nienna Efiriel]], fanned the embers of rebellion and started our journey together, travelling **Mortheim**, [[Tidenheim\|Tidenheim]] and even distant [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Avalon\|Avalon]] and ultimately starting the [[Radovian Rebellion\|Radovian Rebellion]], leading to the [[Battle of Ludwigsstädt\|Battle of Ludwigsstädt]] in 469 3E, the event that directly preceded, and presumably caused, the western part of the nation to be shrouded in thick fog. Following the battle, we would found the fledgling nation of [[Radovia\|Radovia]], doing our best to pick up the pieces of thirteen years of oppression under [[Azael von Zarovich\|Azael von Zarovich]]'s rule.
