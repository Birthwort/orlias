**The Empire of Avalon** is a large Empire in the central south of [[Darrendal\|Darrendal]]. It is comprised mostly of [[Humans\|Humans]], although there is a larger than average percentage of [[Elves\|Elves]] and [[Nephilim\|Nephilim]]. 

It is the dominant power in the northern continent of [[Darrendal\|Darrendal]], defining much of its political climate.

Perhaps most famously, **Avalon** is best known as the birthplace of the [[Church of the Dawnfather\|Church of the Dawnfather]], a widespread religion dedicated to [[Pelor\|Pelor]], the Dawnfather and for its intense hatred of [[Dragons\|Dragonkind]], caused by the circumstances of its founding and persistent cultural trauma.

## History

The **Empire** was founded when the ancient Hero-King [[Gawain Dragonbane\|Gawain Dragonbane]] united scattered human kingdoms and city-states under threat of the invading [[Dragonkind\|Dragons]] during the [[Dragon Wars\|Dragon Wars]]. 

Having won the [[Dragon Wars\|Dragon Wars]] with the unexpected help of the once thought mythical [[High-Elves\|High-Elves]], the freshly formed **Empire** turned it's gaze outwards, in a mission to eradicate all [[Dragons\|Dragons]] that are foolish enough to cross them and to unite [[Darrendal\|Darrendal]] under their Banner, just like [[Gawain Dragonbane\|Gawain Dragonbane]] once did for the **Empire** itself. 

[[Ériu\|Ériu]], **Avalons** southern neighbour and ally in the [[Dragon Wars\|War]], was the first to be conquered. Having lost most of its Territory, Leadership and Army during [[The Day of Snow in Summer\|The Day of Snow in Summer]], it didn't have much in the way of opposition to the invading Army and more or less willingly integrated into the  **Empire**, as the security and protection it provided was preferable to facing the hostile wilds of [[Darrendal\|Darrendal]] in their diminished state. 

For a few centuries after, **Avalon** slowly but surely integrated surrounding territories into itself, solidifying much of the west-avalonian Territory we know today. During that time, a longstanding rivalry between it and [[Cheliax\|Cheliax]], a naval Nation to the east developed. 
**Avalon** might have the upper hand on land, but the [[chelish Navi\|chelish Navi]] dominated the seas and controlled much of the trade to [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Mortheim\|Mortheim]] and distant [[Fortida\|Fortida]].

Eventually, that rivalry came to a head in the [[Hellfire Crisis\|Hellfire Crisis]], when **Avalon** and [[Cheliax\|Cheliax]] clashed in a series of short-term wars until [[Cheliax\|Cheliax]] ultimately had to surrender, getting absorbed into the empire and allowing them to expand their conquest to the seas. This would eventually lead into establishing Mortheim as a vassal of Avalon after installing the faith of the [[Pelor\|Dawnfather]] in the province, which in itself would cause the [[Radovian Rebellion\|Radovian Rebellion]] a few hundred years later. 

During modern days, **Avalon** just badly failed a series of military campaigns into the [[Inland Sea Alliance\|Inland Sea Alliance]], causing the empire to shift gears and try a more subtle, political takeover instead of relying on their brute strength.
