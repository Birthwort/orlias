<small> (The known material plane) </small> 

The **material plane**, the home to [[Humans\|Humans]], [[Dwarves\|Dwarves]], [[Dragons\|Dragons]] and so much more. 
This is a world built on [[Physical Laws\|Physical Laws]], [[Elements\|Elements]] and [[Souls\|Souls]], it's the twin to the [[Ideal Plane\|Ideal Plane]], influencing it and, in turn, being influenced by it. 

**The material plane** was split from the [[Ideal Plane\|Ideal Plane]] aeons ago, when [[The Forebearers\|The Forebearers]] divided their [[World Unsundered\|Ancient World]] in two, thinking it the only way to save reality from [[Them\|Them]]. 

The plane primarily consists out of the interplay of base [[Elements\|Elements]]. 
There are places, where a specific element is found in abundance, making it dominate the Landscape and cause magical anomalies like [[Cloud Sea\|Cloud Sea]], the [[Korangkai Highland\|Korangkai Highland]] or even the volcanic belt known as the [[Wrathpeaks\|Wrathpeaks]]. Those areas are called [[Elemental Epicentres\|Elemental Epicentres]].

These places were long theorized to be the entrances to elemental planes, theoretical [[Worlds\|Worlds]] that consisted only of their [[Element\|Element]], but this notion has since been discarded, as there is no empirical evidence for these spaces. 
As such the modern [[Cosmology\|Cosmology]] of the [[Era of the Dawnfather\|third age]] considers the **material plane** as the *only* material world, with areas in it that align with an element especially closely, just like its sister-plane, the [[Ideal Plane\|Ideal Plane]] and its connections to concepts and ideas.

The second component that makes up the material plane and its inherent [[Magic\|Magic]] are [[Souls\|Souls]], the material Essence of every living being that is touched by the plane. Just like how the [[Ideal Essence\|Ideal Essence]] of a [[Phantasm\|Phantasm]] returns to their concept upon death, the [[Souls\|Soul]] of a being merges back into the world, making up part of the very [[Magic\|Magic]] that pulses through the world. 

Together, [[Elements\|Elements]] and [[Souls\|Souls]] are the components that form [[Material Magic\|Material Magic]]. 
The material plane is full of [[Leylines\|Leylines]] that direct the flow of this [[Magic\|Magic]] through the world, abstract flows of energy that permeate every bit of the plane, rarely coming together and bursting large amounts of new [[Material Magic\|Material Magic]] into the world in [[Leyline Confluences\|Leyline Confluences]] like the [[Seat of Elements\|Seat of Elements]] or [[Kayajima\|Kayajima]].

While, nearly all inhabitants of **the material plane** are not fully material creatures and carry at least a tiny spark of [[Ideal Essence\|Ideal Essence]], there *are* purely material creatures, the most notable examples of such being [[Nature Spirits\|Nature Spirits]], [[Elementals\|Elementals]] and [[Dragons\|Dragons]]. 
There are, however, examples of such creatures being able to exist in the [[Ideal Plane\|Ideal Plane]] and even, rarely, developing their own [[Ideal Essence\|Ideal Essence]], just like how many [[Phantasms\|Phantasms]] are able to do the same with the material. 
There is still much to learn about the nature of our existence.
