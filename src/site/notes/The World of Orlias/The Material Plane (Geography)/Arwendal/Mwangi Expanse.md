The **Mwangi Expanse** is the southwesternmost region of the continent [[Arwendal\|Arwendal]].

Many countries and citystates call it their home, and have done so since the dawn of history, but it is perhaps most well known for being the cradle of [[Magic\|Magic]]. 

It was here that [[Old Mage Jatembe\|Old Mage Jatembe]] rediscovered, and returned, [[Magic\|Magic]] to the world and founded the [[Magaambya\|Magaambya]]

## Geography

The **Mwangi Expanse** lies south of the [[Barrier Wall\|Barrier Wall]] mountainrange seperating it from the [[Terwa Uplands\|Terwa Uplands]]  and the [[Tahl'Aq Confederacy\|Tahl'Aq Confederacy]] and west of [[Brazen Peaks\|Brazen Peaks]], leading to the [[Impossible Lands\|Impossible Lands]].

From the perpetually stormy coast of the [[Sodden Lands\|Sodden Lands]] to the west, to the southern steppes and savannas surrounding [[Mzali\|Mzali]], the **Expanse** is a large and varied region that lays on [[Orlias\|Orlias]] equator. 

### The Sodden Lands
On the eastern coast lay the [[Sodden Lands\|Sodden Lands]], once known as the kingdom of [[Lirgen\|Lirgen]] it used to be a nation of astrologers, philosophers and mathematician, world renowned for their auguries and scientific prowess. 

It was destroyed with the sudden, unforseen and cataclysmic emergence of the [[Elemental Epicentres\|Elemental Epicentre]] known as the [[Eye of Abendhego\|Eye of Abendhego]] sometime in the second era. Nowadays the [[Sodden Lands\|Sodden Lands]] are a far cry from the once proud kingdom, only dregs remain and the people that returned to their country after found it hard to do more than get by. Civilization *is adapting*, and slowly returning, but in modern times it still rarely exceeds the scale of small towns plagued by banditry and pirates.

### The Shackles
South of the [[Sodden Lands\|Sodden Lands]] one would find the [[Shackles\|Shackles]], an extended archipelago off the western coast. It is a haven for pirates and freebooters and ruled by the [[Pirate King\|Pirate King]] out of [[Port Peril\|Port Peril]]. 
There exists evidence of an ancient civilization scattered throughout the shackles and beneath it's waves and many sailors set out in search of treasure among its thousands of islands. 

Many crews that can't make it in the [[Shackles\|Archipelago]] turn their sights to the north and south, trying to establish themselves in the [[Sodden Lands\|Sodden Lands]] or the fledgling nation of [[Vidrian\|Vidrian]] instead.

### Vidrian
Following the southern coast of the **Expanse**, we find [[Vidrian\|Vidrian]]. 
What was once a colony of [[Cheliax\|Cheliax]], an [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Avalon\|avalonian]] vassalstate trying to extend their influence into [[Arwendal\|Arwendal]], has only recently been overthrown by its indigenous population, that the [[Cheliax\|chelish]] colonizers tried to enslave. 

Now they find themselves at the helm of the infrastructure left behind by their old government and having to juggle their old ways with the political ties and debts left behind by their former tyrants, while also having to integrate the [[Cheliax\|chelish]] rebels that sided with them against the slavers.

### The Mwangi Steppes
East of [[Vidrian\|Vidrian]] we enter the mwangi steppes, an area full of nomadic tribes and independent cities. Many tribes of [[Humans\|Humans]] and [[Kholo\|Kholo]] call these steppes their home, but the most notable civilization in the steppes is the massive temple-city of [[Mzali\|Mzali]], the largest [[Arwendal\|arwendalian]] city south of [[Tahl'Aq Confederacy\|Tahl'Aq]]. 

[[Mzali\|Mzali]] is extremely closed off to people from outside of the **Expanse** and ruled by their undead god-emperor [[Walkena\|Walkena]], who rules the city with an iron fist. The [[Walkena\|child-god]] rose from death to destroy looters who sought to plunder the cities riches, and now reigns with opression and cruelty, killing any who question his rule, or even trade with non-Mwangi people. 

### The Mwangi Jungle
Last, but not least, we enter the [[Mwangi Jungle\|Mwangi Jungle]] in the center of the expanse. The jungle does not have any central government, but instead is comprised of many individual city states. 

The three most notable ones are: 

[[Nantambu\|Nantambu]], the home of the [[Magaambya\|Magaambya]], the oldest [[Magic\|Magic]] school in [[Orlias\|Orlias]]. [[Nantambu\|Nantambu]] is both defended, and practically governed, by the [[Magaambya\|Magaambya]], but technically does have an independent government from it. 

It is a on the forefront of magical research and that magic is built into the very foundation of the city. It is rare to find a household or service that doesn't employ magic that would only be seen employed by skilled practicioners on the outside world. 

[[Usaro\|Usaro]], a city at the shores of [[Lake Ocota\|Lake Ocota]] whose original inhabitants mysteriously vanished many years ago. It is only now that people are returning to the city, trying to rebuild its infrastructure and move on from the weird happenings surrounding it.

[[Nagisa\|Nagisa]], an ancient elven ruin to the east of the jungle. 
The [[Alijiae Elves\|Alijiae Elves]] have been slowly reclaiming and rebuilding the city over the past centuries, cleansing it from the [[Demon\|demonic]] presence now inhabiting it after a catastrophe many hundreds of years ago that drove the [[Elf\|Elves]] out, scattering them across the **Expanse**. 

While the outskirts of the city are reclaimed, much of it still remains hostile and many expeditions are organized into the depths of the city to reclaim it piece by piece.
