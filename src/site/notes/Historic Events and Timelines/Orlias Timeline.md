There is ample evidence of civilizations before the first era, but [[Earthfall\|Earthfall]] erased nearly all written record of it and as such we cannot confidently divide it into eras and will simply refer to it as [[Prehistory\|Prehistory]]. 

The first era begins immediately after [[Earthfall\|Earthfall]], and is usually refered to as [[The long Night\|The long Night]]. It is defined by civilization being set back by centuries, and the secrets of [[Magic\|Magic]] were lost to [[Mankind\|Mankind]]. 
There are written mentions of the sun having abandoned the world, but it is unclear how literal that is meant to be.

The start of the second era is marked by [[Old Mage Jatembe\|Old Mage Jatembe]] rediscovering [[Magic\|Magic]] and founding the [[Magaambya\|Magaambya]], a magic academy deep in the jungles of the [[Mwangi Expanse\|Mwangi Expanse]].

The current Era of [[Orlias\|Orlias]] is the third era, commonly known as [[The Era of the Dawnfather\|The Era of the Dawnfather]], defined by the cultural domination of [[The World of Orlias/The Material Plane (Geography)/Darrendal/Avalon\|Avalon]] and the continually spreading Influence of the [[Church of the Dawnfather\|Church of the Dawnfather]].
